# 🧬 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on diagnostic data using machine learning models. The notebook contains all steps from data cleaning and visualization to building interpretable models for medical prediction.

## 📊 Project Overview

Early diagnosis of diabetes can help reduce complications and improve long-term health outcomes. In this notebook, we:

- Analyze and preprocess health data
- Visualize feature relationships
- Build classification models to predict diabetes
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## 📁 File Structure

📦 Diabetes_Prediction
┣ 📄 Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
┗ 📄 README.md

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Handling zero and missing values in medical measurements
  - Feature scaling with standardization

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Histograms and KDE plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Class balance check

- **Modeling**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Confusion matrix
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Curve

## 📌 Key Features

- Well-commented, beginner-friendly code
- End-to-end pipeline from data loading to prediction
- Emphasis on interpretability and performance
- Easily extendable to real-world health datasets

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
